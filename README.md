üîç **Key Findings**

**1. Online vs Offline Services**

About 39.19% of restaurants offer online ordering, this shows that majority of the resturants do not offer online services.

Only 5.41% offer table booking services.

Online ordering is significantly more common than table booking.

In terms of preference, only Dinning resturants favor offline orders over online orders.

**2. Most Favored Restaurant Types**

Dining restaurants are  the most popular by votes with 20, 363 total votes, this is more than double the votes of the next closest category.

"Others" come second with strong customer engagement.


**3. Couple Price Preferences**

By total number of votes, the mid-range (301-600) is the most popular price category for couples.

The histogram shows that most of the resturants in our data set tend to keep pricing for couples on the lower side of the price spectrum, between 50 and 300.
